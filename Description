A React-based web application that presents COVID data to users through visuals and offers updates through AWS SNS on COVID data changes.
My project involves the deployment of a web application that provides Covid data in graphs using an API. 
In the web application, there will be functionalities for the user to click through each widget pertaining to Covid to find whatever widget the user is interested in (ex. state trends). If a user wants to subscribe to our web application, then they must enter their email address and users will receive an SMS alert from the AWS SNS notification service if the data has undergone a significant change based on the thresholds that have been predefined. The phone numbers of the users are stored in a Firebase database that captures all the userâ€™s data. Finally, users authenticate using Google to the web application to reduce online theft.
